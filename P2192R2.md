## 1. Abstract

This is a proposal about logical, feasible, lightweight and effective handling of information returned from functions, based on an paradigm shift. Returns handling, **not** yet another error handling solution. 

This paper proposes an paradigm shift. An utility to a solution to a large proportion of deeply rooted issues [[3](#ref3)][[15](#ref15)]. Implemented, this would be an tiny std library citizen without a language change required.

<span id="motivation" />

## 2. Motivation 

### 2.1. No standard returns handling paradigm

As of today, in the std lib, there are few (or more than few) non interoperable error handling paradigms, idioms and return types. From ancient to old. None of them dealing with general function returns in an satisfactory manner. Added through time they have together inevitably contributed to a rising technical debt present inside C++ std lib. 

What is "Returns handling"? Returns handling is the evolution of error handling. It is the true picture of real life code. API consuming algorithms, required to deal with wider scope of issues, opposed to a simple "was there an error or not?", boolean logic. 

There is none in the std lib of such pervasive, paradigm and mechanism. Dotted on the wast C++ landscape are some "home grown" solutions to the general returns handling in large C++ code bases. Think HTTP codes handling algorithms, as an example. Lack of a common and ubiquitous non trivial returns handling solutions is raising the level of complexity for all levels of application architectures developed with standard C++. 

Motivation is to aid architectures for C++ projects, solving three core requirements categories

1. Run-Time
2. Interoperability
3. Energy

### 2.2. Run-Time requirements

Key reason for appearance of C++ dialects, are to be found in strict run-time requirements. That essentially means developing using the core language but [without the std lib](https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL). 

One motivation of this paper is to try and offer an "over arching", but simple enough, returns handling paradigm applicable across standard C++ landscape. And possibly across fast growing C++ dialects, fragmenting away the industry and markets. 

**Minimal list**

1. can not use try / throw / catch[[6](#ref6)][[15](#ref15)] 
2. can not use \<system_error\>[[14](#ref14)]
3. do not use `iostreams`

 Author will be so bold not to delve into the background of this list, in order to keep this paper simple and focused. Gaming, embedded systems, high performance computing, are just the tip of the iceberg to which C++ ship might be heading. Perhaps pathetic but true statement.

### 2.3. Interoperability

Each solution to those strict run-time requirements is adding yet another nail in the coffin of interoperability. In danger of sounding like offering an panacea,  author will also draw the attention to the malleability of the metastate paradigm to be implemented with wide variety of languages used in developing components of an modern distributed system. 

Usability of an API is measured on all levels: from the code level, to the inter component level. 

In order to design any API to be feasibly usable it has to be interoperable. That leads to three core requirements:

**Interoperable API core attributes**

1. no "error code" as return value
   1. Complexity is in "special" error codes multiplied with different types multiplied with different context
   2. That is increasing the learning curve for every function in every API
   3. How to decode the error code, becomes a prominent issue
2. no "return arguments" 
   1. type specific, mutable argument solutions are definitely not interoperable.  
3. no special globals
   1. Think errno legacy 
   2. pure functions must not use globals

Some of the designed-in simplicity in this paper is an result of deliberate attempt to increase the interoperability (with other run-time environments and languages). Think interoperability using standard C++ for: [WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/C_to_wasm), [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html), [Android](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code) and such. 

### 2.4. Energy requirement

Data centers large energy consumption has become imperative to solve. Most of the server side software is written in C/C++ . Pressure is on, to design and develop using standard C++ but also with energy consumption as an primary requirement. 

[This one is not "simple" requirement](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01496266/document). Somewhat paradoxically this category of requirements requires less and less code. Smaller code and smaller executables means less energy spent when that executable is running.

## 3. metastate

### 3.1. Field

Let us postulate the existence of a function: 
```cpp
 // returns true if field is not empty
       bool is_empty( Field ) ;
```
That is (in a simple manner) letting us know what is the state of occupancy of an "field". But what is this "Field" type ?

C++ "field" is analogous to the database field.

The "field" is the name of an  "single piece of information", in database theory also known as "field". "field" in the database is what in C++ is: *"a particular piece of data encapsulated within a class or object"* [ref [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(computer_science))]. 

#### 3.1.1. Occupancy states

Field can be in two "occupancy states"; we will call them : empty and occupied.

As an example, `std::optional` is a well known implementation of a field, also known as "container of one". Class holding only one variable defined in a class. An instance of that class might be tested if it is empty. Not holding a value or "empty". Occupied or "holding a value".

#### 3.1.2. Definition

As meta-language is language of languages, **metastate** is "state of states". metastate is defined as an boolean AND combination of occupancy states of two fields. Namely: Value and Status. A bit more formally.

```
; two possible occupancy states
empty     ::= true | false
has_value ::= true | false
occupancy_state ::== empty | has_value
; field is made of
; occupancy state and value
field ::=  occupancy_state AND value

; metastate is AND combination of 
; two fields occupancies
value  ::= field
status ::= field

; state of occupancy_state of two fields
metastate ::= is_empty(value) AND is_empty(status)

; valstat is made of
valsat ::= value AND status
``` 
Combination of value *and* status occupancies is giving four possible metastates. We will name them.

| Meta State Tag | Value occupancy  | op | Status occupancy  |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| **Info**  | Has value | AND | Has value |
| **OK**    | Has value | AND | Empty     |
| **Error** | Empty     | AND | Has value |
| **Empty** | Empty     | AND | Empty     |

metastate names are just tags, they are not dictating required behaviour. 

That is the core idea we shall use when solving the requirements listed in the Motivation section. Put in some simple code, metastate idea is really rather simple and easy to comprehend.  In adopting the metastate paradigm we do not inspect values, we inspect the relationship of two fields returned.
```cpp
// there is no special type returned
// both are fields 
auto [value, status] = metastate_enabled_function ();
```
In C++ there is actually no need for existence of metastate type.  We only care about the relationship between two fields states of occupancy.
Metastate capturing is the act of decoding that relationship. Following is canonical capturing of the four metastates using the two fields.

```cpp
// This is not C++. 
// two fields are input into the idiom of
// capturing all four possible metastates
// 
  if (   is_empty( value ) &&   is_empty( status )  { /* info */ }
  if (   is_empty( value ) && ! is_empty( status )  { /* ok   */ }
  if ( ! is_empty( value ) &&   is_empty( status )  { /* error*/ }
  if ( ! is_empty( value ) && ! is_empty( status )  { /* empty*/ }
```
In standard C++ reality we do not need is_empty() function from above. Let's assume we use `std::optional` as a field type.
```cpp
// C++
// fields are std::optional intances
auto [value, status] = metastate_enabled_function ();

  if (   value &&   status )  { /* info */ }
  if (   value && ! status )  { /* ok   */ }
  if ( ! value &&   status )  { /* error*/ }
  if ( ! value && ! status )  { /* empty*/ }
```
metastate serves well for arriving to cleaner algorithms for complex returns handling. The aded benefits are immediate applicability and ability in addressing the requirements from the [Motivation section](#motivation).
  
This proposal is not describing an [panacea](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/panacea). It's value also lies in deliberate simplicity, aiding in solving the interoperability. 

Universal adoption of the metastate paradigm, would be greatly aided by placing one tiny template in the standard C++ std lib. This proposal requires no changes in the core language. Truth to be told there is not a single type proposed. Just one template.

<!-- div class="page"/ -->

## 4. valstat

In order to achieve the required wide scope of the metastate coverage, there are are only few core recommendations as described above. Metastate actual C++ shape is completely context free. Put simply the C++ std lib implementation must not dictate the usage beside supporting the paradigm. 

"valstat" is a name of the template, offering the greatest possible degree of freedom for metastate adopters. Implementation is simple, resilient, lightweight and feasible. Almost transparent.

The only requirement is to give callers, the opportunity to capture the four metastates, returned by some "meta state enabled" API.

**Synopsis**

*std::valstat\<T,S\>* as a template is an generic interface whose aliases and definitions allow the easy metastates capturing by examining the state of occupancy of the 'value' and 'status' fields.

```cpp
#pragma once
// std lib header: <valstat>
namespace std 
{
 template< typename V, typename S >
	struct [[nodiscard]] valstat
 {
    // both types must be able to 
    // simply and resiliently
    // exhibit state of occupancy
    // "empty" or "has value"
		using value_field_type  = V ;
		using status_field_type = S ;

    // metastate is captured by combining
    // state of occupancy of these two fields

		value_field_type   value;
		status_field_type  status;
 };
} // std
```
> Valstat definitions are vessels for carrying metastates

*std::valstat* will be assuring the metastate presence in the standard C++. It will not mandate its usage in any way. It should be in a separate header *\<valstat\>*, to allow for complete decoupling from any of the std lib types and headers.

**Type requirements**

Both value and status type must offer an simple mechanism that reveals their occupancy state. Readily available example of that behaviour is [std::optional<T>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional) type.

<span id="my_valstat" ></span>

### 4.1. my::valstat 

Is an std::valstat variation we will actually use in examples in this proposal. As an illustration of the malleability of the proposed solution, we will solve the occupancy requirement imposed on valstat fields by simply using std::optional. No thousands of lines of C++ is required for some special type. No need to be concerned about the implementation complexity[[13](#ref13)]. 
```cpp
// in some adopters namespace 
namespace my {
// ready to operate on almost any type
// std::optional rules permitting
template<typename T, typename S>
using valstat = std::valstat< 
         std::optional<T>, 
         std::optional<S> >;
} // my
```
In standard C++ view of my::valstat it is not wrong to relax a metastate definition, as an "AND combination" of two std::optionals.

Now both API code and API callers have the generic readily applicable valstat template alias. Most of the time valstat C++ users will use a structured binding. Let's see some ad-hoc examples of direct usage, no functions involved yet:
```cpp
   // ERROR metastate created
   // both fields are std::option<int> instances
	auto [ value, status ] = my::valstat< int, int >{ {}, 42 };

// ERROR metastate captured
// compare the fields occupancy
	if (! value && status ) {
      /* use the status value from inside a field instance */
		std::cout << "error status: " << *status ;
	}
```
The other three metastates wil be instantiated like so:
```cpp
   // both fields are std::option<int> instances
	auto [ value, status ] = my::valstat< int, int >{ 42, {} }; // OK
	auto [ value, status ] = my::valstat< int, int >{ 42, 42 }; // INFO
	auto [ value, status ] = my::valstat< int, int >{ {}, {} }; // EMPTY
```
### 4.2. Fundamental types as fields

After all this postulating and a field theory it might come as a surprise, in some narrow circumstances it is quite ok and enough to be using fundamental types for both value and status fields. For example.
```cpp
   // notice we use "naked" std::valstat
   // both value and status fields in here are int's
	auto [ value, status ] = std::valstat< int, int >{ {}, 42 };

// ERROR metastate captured
// (!0 && 42) yields true
if ( ! value && status ) { 
   cout << *value ; // 42
}

// other three metastates
// both fields are int's
	auto [ value, status ] = std::valstat< int, int >{ 42, {} }; // OK
	auto [ value, status ] = std::valstat< int, int >{ 42, 42 }; // INFO
	auto [ value, status ] = std::valstat< int, int >{ {}, {} }; // EMPTY

```
Still a metastate capturing. It is only we have decided, in some context field types can be simple int's.  That is possible because we declared in that same context we will think of int as empty if it is zero. 
```cpp
// in some specific context int is "empty" if it is zero
bool is_empty( int vak_ ) {   return ! val_ ; }
```
Above is rather important feature for projects mentioned in the motivation section as that solution is not using std lib.
<!-- div class="page"/ -->

## 5. Usage

It is admittedly hard to immediately see the connection between metastate and valstat, and the somewhat bold promises about wide spectrum of benefits, presented in the [motivation section](#motivation). 

There are many equally simple and convincing examples of metastate usage benefits. In order to keep this core proposal short we will first observe just one, but illustrative use-case. [Appendix A](#8-appendix-a) contains few more. 

### 5.1. Callers point of view

Returns handling: valstat instance carries (out of the function) information to be utilized by callers capturing the metastate. How and why (or why not) is the metastate capturing code shaped, that completely depends on the project adopting it, the API logic and many other requirements dictated by adopters architects and developers. 

Example bellow might be used by adopters operating on some database. In this illustration, adopters use the metastate to pass back (to the caller) full information, obtained after the database field fetching operation. Again, there here is no 'special' over-elaborated return type required. That is a good thing. Metastate is a paradigm, there is no 'metastate' type just idioms of metastate capturing. 

 ```cpp
 // we handle the returns not errors only
 // declaration of a metastate emitting function
 // or valstat returning function
 template<typename T>
// we use the `my::valstat` type. 
// `my::stat` is code type from some home-grown code/message implementation.
   my::valstat<T, my::stat > 
   full_field_info
   (database::row /*row_*/ , std::string_view /* field_name */ ) 
// valstat carry no exception throwing requirements   
   noexcept ;
```
Primary objective is enabling callers comprehension of a full information passed out of the function. Not just error handling. Satisfying the core requirements from the [motivation section](#2-motivation). 
```cpp
// full return handling after 
// the attempted number type, value retrieval
// from the database 
// value and status are valstat fields
auto [ value, status ] = full_field_info<int>( db_row, field_name ) ;
```
In this scenario caller is capturing all four metastates.
```cpp
if (   value &&   status )  { 
   // metastate captured: info 
   std::cout << "\nSpecial value found: " << *value ;
   // *status type is my::stat
   std::cout << "\nStatus is: " << my::status_message(*status) ;
  }

if (   value && ! status )  { 
   // metastate captured: ok 
   std::cout << "\nRetrieved value: " << *value ;
  }

if ( ! value &&   status )  { 
   // metastate captured: error 
   // in this example status contains an error code
   std::cout << "\nRead error: " <<  my::status_message(*status) ;
  }

if ( ! value && ! status )  { 
   // metastate captured: empty 
   std::cout << "\nField is empty." ;
  }

 ```
Please do note, using the same paradigm it is almost trivial to imagine that same calling algorithm in e.g. JavaScript inside some node.js calling module written in C++ returning valstat object that JavaScript will understand. 

Also let us emphasize: Not all possible metastates need to be captured by the caller each and every time. It entirely depends on the API "contract", on the logic of the calling site, on application requirements and such.

### 5.2. the API point of view

Requirements permitting, API implementers are free to choose if they will use and return them all, one,two or three metastates. In the scenario they return all all of them.

```cpp
// implementation in the API namespace
template<typename T>
my::valstat<T, my::stat > 
full_field_info
(database::row row_, std::string_view field_name ) 
// not throwing exceptions.
            noexcept 
{
   // sanity check
   if ( field_name.size() < 1) 
    // return ERROR metastate
      return { {}, my::stat::name_empty };      

   // using some hypothetical database API
   database::field_descriptor field = row_.fetch( field_name ) ;
 
    if ( field.in_error() ) 
    // return ERROR metastate
      return { {}, (my::stat::db_api_error)field.error() };      

    if ( field.is_empty() ) 
    // empty field is not an error
    // return EMPTY metastate 
      return { {}, {} };      

   // db type will have to be cast into the type T
   // we assume T properly handles move/copy etc.
   T field_value{} ; 
   if ( false == field.data( field_value ) )
   // return ERROR metastate 
      return { {},  (my::stat::type_cast_failed)field.error() }; 

 // API contract requires signalling if 'special' value is found
  if ( special_value( field_value ) )       
  // return INFO metastate
   return { field_value, my::stat::special_value }; 

// just some value 
// OK metastate 
   return { field_value, {} }; 
}
```
Basically function returning the metastate is simply returning two fields structure. With all the advantages and disadvantages imposed by the core language rules. Any kind of home grown but functional valstat will work too. As long as callers can capture the metastates by using its instances.

To achieve the above One does not even need to use std::valstat derivation to employ the benefits of the metastate paradigm. It entirely depends on the adopters requirements. It can by any "valstat like" type. Using thread safe abstractions, or asynchronous processing is also not stopping the adopters to return the metastates from their API's.

## 6. Conclusions

*Fundamentally, the burden of proof is on the proposers.* — B. Stroustrup, [[11]](#ref11)

Hopefully proving the evolution of error code handling into returns handling does not need much convincing. There are many real code situation where the metastate paradigm can be used. As an common call returns handling paradigm, metastate requires to be ubiquitously adopted to become truly an instrumental to widespread interoperability. From micro to macro levels. From inside the code to inter components calls.

Developing standard C++ code using standard library, but in restricted run-time environments, is what one might call a "situation"[[3](#ref3)][[4](#ref4)][[11](#ref11)]. Author is certain readership knows quite well why is that situation unresolved. There is no need for yet another [tractate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tractate), in the form of proposal to try and overcome that situation. 

Authors primary aim is to achieve widespread adoption of this paradigm. As shown metastate is more than solving the "error-signalling problem"[[11](#ref11)]. It is an paradigm, instrumental in solving the often hard and orthogonal set of run-time requirements described in the [motivation section](#2-motivation).

*"A paradigm is a standard, perspective, or set of ideas. A paradigm is a way of looking at something ... When you change paradigms, you're changing how you think about something..."* [vocabulary.com](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/paradigm)

<!-- 
<h3>What might be the components of metastate possible success?</h3>

**metastate** is a concept (idea); valstat is metastate carrier with recommending behavioral pattern. The rest is optional and individual.

**metastate** is not mandatory
**metastate** has almost universal applicability.

**metastate** as a concept is simple, consistent, logical, easy to understand and feasible to use.

**valstat** and its user defined implementations, provide extremely light, easy to optimize code. It does not stand in the way of any C++ project to design and use project specific idioms based on valstat.
**valstat** as a template is an abstract interface. 

**metastate** has the potential of increasing interoperability for the C++ landscape at large. "Everyone" using the valstat idiom, means that everyone will consume each others API easier. Even if types returned are "foreign" to the logic of the caller. Compare this to catching exceptions from third party libraries, in one place. 
**metastate** is "legacy friendly". It can be very gradually introduced. No code breaks are necessary. 
-->

<!-- After reading [[P0976]](https://www.stroustrup.com/P0976-the-evils-of-paradigms.pdf) "The Evils of Paradigms", we might claim that metastate is **not** an "Elvis of Paradigms".  -->

metastate aims high. And the scope of metastate is rather wide. But is is a humble paradigm. It is just an simple and effective way of building bridges over one deeply fragmented part of the vast C++ territory. While imposing extremely little on adopters implementations and leaving the non-adopters to "proceed as before".
<!--
- metastate (and valstat) has the potential to improve and simplify the function return handling, universally across the C++ landscape at large. And, simplifications inevitably brings resilience.

- The more universally it is used, more valuable metastate idea will be. And if valstat has the prefix *std::* it has a chance of becoming truly adopted.

- metastate consuming code means local return handling. for that reason valstat consuming function are undeniably more complex. Writing safer code is not simpler v.s. writing the dangerous code.  Both writing functions producing and consuming valstat enabled API is undeniably more complex. But not necessarily slower code. Hardly anyone might be worried usage of *std::valstat* will increase compilation times or slow down execution times considerably.

- Naturally valstat usage leads to lighter executable because there is almost no need for exceptions machinery (besides throwing from constructors). Which also gives to the compiler the opportunity to fully optimize the code. 

- After all truly performance critical code need not use valstat. Fastest code is the one not checking function returns. And that is certainly not making it resilient, low maintenance code. A fine balance between fast and dangerous and safe but slower.

- Also metastate deliberate simplicity serves the purpose of **interoperability**. With C++ API's, with C API's or even with other languages depending on the run-time. Think [WASM](https://webassembly.org/), [NODE.JS](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html), some [mobile OS](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code), etc.

2020Q3 C++ community urgently needs an standard and recommended solution for uniformly handling non trivial returns from functions. 

Barriers to the ubiquity of metastate, as ever with any new ideas, will be non-technical. But it is not standing in the way in any sense.
-->

Obstacles to metastate paradigm adoption are far from just technical. But here is at least an immediately usable attempt to chart the way out.

## 8. Appendix A

*To me, one of the hallmarks of good programming is that the code looks so simple that you are tempted to dismiss the skill of the author. Writing good clean understandable code is hard work whatever language you are using -- Francis Glassborow*

Value of the programming paradigm is best understood by seeing the code using it. The more the merrier. Here are a few more simple examples illustrating the metastate applicability. All following the [initial set of requirements](#2-motivation).

**metastate as a value carrier**

An elegant solution to the "index out of bounds" problem. No exceptions, no `assert()` and no `exit()` in release builds. Using [my::valstat](#41-myvalstat) as already defined above. 

```cpp
// inside some sequence like container
// see the my::valstat above.
// my::errc is std::errc, minus <system_error> included. 
 my::valstat< T , my::errc >
     operator [] ( size_t idx_ ) noexcept
    {
        if ( ! ( idx_ < size_ ) )
        /* ERROR metastate */
        return { {}, my::errc::invalid_argument };
        /* OK metastate */
        return { data_[idx_] , {} };
    }
```
Metastate does carry the value. But only if metastates are OK or INFO. That pattern alone resolves few difficult and common API design issues.

**Uniform solutions for simpler usage**

Due to decades of legacy code development and debugging, inevitably its usage and complexity has become a problem. True even for C++ std lib. Somewhat trivial example: To find a char inside an std::string one can use std::find. To find a string inside the same std::string, one has to use std::string::find. metastate based solution out of this might be:

```cpp
// value is a position in a sequence being searched
template<class C, class T>
   constexpr  my::valstat< size_t, my::errc >
      my::find(C const & container_ , const T& value) noexcept;
```
using the overloads of above one can imagine a simple variety of implementations but all serving the same find consuming logic at the client side. Using the vector first.
```cpp    
    int n1 = 3 ;
    std::vector<int> v{0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
   auto [position,status] = my::find(v, n1);
```
Or using the string
```cpp
   char n1 = '3' ;
    std::string s{"01234"};
   // using std::string overloads 
   auto [position,status] = my::find(s, n1);
```
Find a string inside a string
```cpp
   string n2 = "23" ;
   auto [position,status] = my::find(s, n2);
```
metastate presence brings uniformity in algorithms using that API. That in turn makes applications simpler and more resilient. The same find logic is applicable to all containers and sequences alike. ( std::string::npos is not required ).
```cpp 
// always the same find consuming logic 
// based on metastate capturing 
if ( position )
   {
      // position is guaranteed to be inside boundaries
      my::process_the_find( v[*position] ) ;
   } else {
      // not found, status contains the reason
      my::process_the_status( *status ) ;
   }
```
Above is certainly doable without a metastate, but it will require yet another design and some new set of abstractions. Remember [std::to_chars](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/to_chars) use case. Otherwise one useful utility, but that returns yet another return type. An newcomer in std lib. Inevitably raising the technical debt of not having common returns handling paradigm, policy and implementation. 

**Decoupling from the legacy**

One can imagine using the metastate paradigm for developing simple but ubiquitous proxy API in front of the legacy API's.
```cpp
// notice here we even do not use my::valstat
inline std::valstat<FILE*, errno_t > 
  modern_fopen(const char* name_, const char* mode_) 
noexcept
{
    FILE* fp_{};
    int ec_ = fopen_s(&fp_, name_, mode_);

    if (NULL == fp_)
        // returning the ERROR metastate
        return { {} ,  ec_ }; 

    // returning the OK metastate
    return { fp_, {} }; // OK metastate
}
```
Very simple but fully metastate enabled. The usage:
```cpp
if (auto [ filep , errc ] = modern_fopen( "non_existent_file" , "w+" ); filep )
{
   // filep is a FILE *
   fprintf( filep, "OK" ) ;
}  else {
   // ad-hoc usage
   auto message = strerror( ( errc != 0 ? strerror (errc) : "no status") ) ;
}
```
Above decouples from decades of "special return values" ,`errno` globals and POSIX "hash defines". One can imagine the whole layer of metastate enabled functions, in front of the CRT legacy.
