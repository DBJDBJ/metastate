## metastate

*"A paradigm is a standard, perspective, or set of ideas. A paradigm is a way of looking at something ... When you change paradigms, you're changing how you think about something..."* [vocabulary.com](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/paradigm)

metastate is an software architecture paradigm. metastate is not yet another error return handling idiom. More precisely metastate is a paradigm about obtaining more information as a result of a function call. 

##  valstat

std::valstat is an metastate C++ implementation. std::valstat would be instrumental to the usability of metastate in C++ programs. 

> Together metastate and valstat are assembling an programming behaviour pattern.
